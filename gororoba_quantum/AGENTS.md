# gororoba_quantum agent guide

This file applies to the runnable modules, families, contracts and the live runner under `gororoba_quantum/`. The repository's root AGENTS.md
carries every other rule and loads first; the section below repeats its
algebra circuit design rules byte for byte so they bind work started here.
Paths are repository-relative.

## Algebra circuit design rules

These rules bind every circuit, case, analysis and note that encodes
Cayley-Dickson arithmetic on a qubit register. The root AGENTS.md,
gororoba_quantum/AGENTS.md and scripts/AGENTS.md carry this section with
identical bytes; `ci/check_agents_sections.py` fails on any difference.
`docs/evidence/reviewer_associator_audit/`
replays the arithmetic behind each rule, and gates sources-240 and
sources-241 check it.

**Encoding and representation.**
- The map `a -> L_a` is a linear encoding, not an algebra homomorphism.
  Associative matrix composition represents a non-associative product through
  `(L_a L_b - L_ab) c = -(a, b, c)` with `(a, b, c) = (ab)c - a(bc)`: two
  wirings compared by an observable, never a claim that matrix products
  fail to associate. A faithful associative representation of a
  non-associative product does not exist.
- A sedenion-coefficient encoding states its coefficient domain (real or
  complex), normalization, basis convention (`cd_core.cd_sign`, doubling
  `(a, b)(c, d) = (ac - conj(d) b, da + b conj(c))`) and scale. The basis
  state `|0>` is `e_0 = 1`, the multiplicative identity, never the zero
  vector. A unitary cannot output the zero vector: an algebraic zero product
  is a heralded branch of zero probability while the full state keeps norm 1.
- Norm multiplicativity and Hurwitz-type statements apply to real
  coefficients. The complex-linear extension has zero divisors even on
  associative subalgebras: `(e_0 + i e_1)(e_0 - i e_1) = 0`.

**Zero-product witnesses.**
- Certify every claimed zero-divisor pair with `cd_core` before circuit work.
  Four product terms that land on four distinct XOR labels cannot cancel:
  `(e1 + e10)(e2 - e13) = e3 + e7 + e8 - e12`, which is the repository's
  negative regression fixture (fixed-operand LCU `P(s = 0) = 1/2`). The
  corpus pair `(e1 + e10)(e4 - e15) = 0` is the dark witness, and
  `(e1 + e10)(e4 + e15)` is its bright control (`P(s = 0) = 1`).
- Read the selector's success outcome, not "output label unequal to zero".
  The fixed-operand LCU of Design B gives `P(s = 0) = ||x y||^2 / 2` for
  normalized `x = (e_i + t e_j)/sqrt2` and `y`. The universal coefficient
  contraction `M|i, j> = sigma(i, j)|i xor j>` has `M M^dagger = D I`, so its
  success Kraus operator is `M / sqrt(D)` and `P = ||x y||^2 / D`. Reports
  give success counts, attempts, the bright reference, the uncertainty and
  the implemented normalization; the dark floor carries preparation, coherent
  control, incoherent, readout and sampling contributions together.

**Signs, workspace and measurement basis.**
- A sign register prepared in `|0>` records the sign as a which-path label;
  phase kickback needs the register in `|->`, where `X|-> = -|->`. Every
  retained input or workspace register that differs between branches
  suppresses their interference and enters the overlap.
- Before two computation branches recombine, return every temporary register
  to a common state (undo branch-specific XORs), and include all registers in
  the overlap calculation.
- In a Hadamard test, `<X_c>` before the final H, or `<Z_c>` after it, equals
  `Re<psi_L|psi_R>`; `X_c` measured after the final H reads the pre-H `Z_c`,
  which is 0 for balanced branches.
- A uniform superposition over all `16^3` sedenion basis triples gives
  witness expectation `1 - 2(1848/4096) = 25/256` and `P(c = 1) = 231/512`;
  the deterministic `-1` belongs to a single non-associating triple or to
  input supported inside that sign sector.

**Observables and claims.**
- Associator-sign measurement, zero-product success and state-coherence
  reconstruction are three observables. The fixed-pair witness
  `W_ij = L_(e_i e_j)^dagger L_(e_i) L_(e_j)` is diagonal, so its expectation
  `sum_k rho_kk omega(i, j, k)` reconstructs no coherence of the data
  register; coherences need their own basis settings (for a two-qubit pair,
  XX, XY, YX, YY with the register order fixed).
- Logical register counts: fixed-pair associator test, 4 data qubits plus 1
  control; fixed sparse operand zero-product LCU, 4 data qubits plus 1
  selector; two-input signed lookup, 8 input qubits plus 1 sign qubit; three
  independent input registers with coherent branch control, 12 input qubits
  plus 1 control plus workspace. Routed gate costs are measured separately.
- Name the interferometer an associator-sign interference witness; a
  holonomy claim needs a parameter space, transport rule and closed-loop
  observable. Non-Abelian braiding is noncommutative and associative and
  supports no non-associativity claim. A circuit construction establishes
  ideal implementability, hardware data establish performance under a stated
  implementation, and a priority claim needs a separate literature
  comparison.
- IBM removed pulse-level control on 3 February 2025; designs use the gate
  set, fractional gates and dynamic circuits.
